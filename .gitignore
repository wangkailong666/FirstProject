# *.spec # Commenting this out as we want to keep main.spec
# If a .spec file is generated by `pyinstaller main.py` command, it would be `main.spec`.
# Since we are manually creating and versioning `main.spec`, we don't want to ignore it.
# If users generate other .spec files, they can add them manually or use a more specific ignore.
